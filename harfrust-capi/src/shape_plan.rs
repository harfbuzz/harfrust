//! Reusable shape plans and the segment properties that identify them.
//! Mirrors HarfBuzz's `hb-shape-plan.h`.
//!
//! A plan captures everything that can be worked out from a face, a set of
//! segment properties and a list of features, before any text is seen. Building
//! one is the expensive half of shaping, so a plan built once can be executed
//! over many buffers that share those properties.
//!
//! [`hr_shape`](crate::hr_shape) already reuses plans through a per-face cache,
//! so reach for this only when you want to hold a plan yourself.
